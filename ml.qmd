Hiring Manager
Hill International – San Diego Office

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to apply for the **Financial Analyst I** position at Hill International. As a Financial Economics senior at Brigham Young University–Idaho (B.S. expected July 2025) with hands-on experience building financial models and dashboards, I am excited to contribute my analytical skills and project mindset to a firm renowned for protecting client interests throughout the construction project lifecycle.

In my academic and project work I have **designed end-to-end financial and [economic simulations](https://1ramirez7.github.io/projects/longrun/lrsolow.html) in R/Shiny** and **conducted [time-series](https://1ramirez7.github.io/projects/china/chinatime.html) forecasting of international trade flows**—projects that demanded rigorous data cleaning, multi-scenario modeling, and clear presentation of insights to non-technical stakeholders. While serving as an **Analytic Research Intern at E\&J Investments**, I evaluated investment opportunities, delivering recommendations that improved strategic decision-making. These experiences sharpened my **advanced Excel and financial modeling abilities** and familiarized me with SQL-based financial systems, aligning directly with the analytical support and forecasting responsibilities outlined in your posting.

Hill International’s need for analysts who can **juggle multiple concurrent projects** mirrors my own workload at BYU-Idaho, where I simultaneously tutored economics students, assisted faculty on equity-valuation coursework, and led the university’s Investment Society. Balancing these commitments honed my ability to **prioritize deliverables, communicate findings concisely, and collaborate across teams**—skills critical to meeting your clients’ budget-execution and reporting deadlines.

I am eager to bring my quantitative toolkit, Bloomberg certification, and San Diego roots to Hill International’s growing West-Coast operation. I welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background in financial analysis and data-driven decision support can help your team exceed client expectations.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Eduardo I. Ramirez
