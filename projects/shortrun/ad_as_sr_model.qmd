Eduardo built a full‑stack Shiny application that stress‑tests the short‑run Aggregate‑Demand/Aggregate‑Supply framework. The tool simulates inflation, output gaps, Taylor‑rule dynamics, and nominal interest‑rate paths across 5 – 100 periods, comparing up to four simultaneous policy or shock scenarios against a counterfactual baseline.

#### Key engineering achievements

| Focus | Highlights |
|-------|------------|
| **Modular architecture** | Business math lives in `simulate_solow()` and `mathformulas.R`; UI logic stays clean and reactive. |
| **Experiment engine** | Helper factories generate four independent DT tables with add/delete buttons, Excel uploads, and reactive storage—users can queue complex exogenous‑shock schedules in seconds. |
| **Endogenous overrides** | A parallel helper lets users overwrite core variables (inflation, output, Taylor‑rule paths) for single‑period “what‑if” adjustments. |
| **Math‑explanation module** | A namespaced module renders MathJax equations with live numeric substitution for any selected period—perfect for teaching or model auditing. |
| **Reactive plot cache** | All ggplot objects are stored in a `reactiveValues` list, rendered on demand, and zipped to PNGs for download. |

#### Visual analytics & UX

* Ten high‑resolution ggplot panels: inflation & output under three policy rules, nominal rate, demand‑shock parameters, etc.  
* Toggle switches layer counterfactual, 2nd‑, 3rd‑, and 4th‑scenario lines without cluttering the view.  
* Custom **bslib** theme, centered titles, and point‑thinning keep plots readable even for long horizons.  
* CSV export of any simulation plus one‑click ZIP of all plots.

---

#### Economic rigor

* Implements full short‑run dynamics: inflation Phillips curve, output gap equations, Taylor‑rule feedback, and nominal rate composition.  
* AS/AD schematic (placeholder) ready for diagrammatic extensions.  
* Multivariable‑calculus‑based formulas embedded with step‑by‑step numeric substitution.

---

#### Software craftsmanship

* Version‑tagged comments (`v0.1` – `v4.3`) document iterative development.  
* Defensive validation (modals for missing experiments), informative tooltips, and namespaced UI modules prevent conflicts.  
* Production‑ready for **shinyapps.io** or **RStudio Connect** deployment.

#### Technologies showcased

| Domain | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| **Advanced R** | reactive programming, functional helpers, tidy data |
| **Shiny** | dynamic tabsets, DT tables, file I/O, downloads |
| **Data viz** | ggplot2 with thematic consistency and legend control |
| **Macroeconomics** | short‑run AD‑AS mechanics, Taylor‑rule feedback |
| **Software design** | modular sources, version control markers |

**Employer takeaway**

Eduardo translates complex short‑run macro theory into an elegant, interactive web tool—demonstrating deep economics expertise, polished R/Shiny craftsmanship, and clean, maintainable code.
