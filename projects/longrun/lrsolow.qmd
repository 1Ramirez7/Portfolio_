Eduardo engineered an interactive Solow‑Romer growth simulator that lets users test how savings, depreciation, population growth, R&D effort, and productivity shocks shape capital deepening and long‑run output. The app supports four independent experiment tabs plus a counterfactual, turning the classic model into a powerful classroom and policy sandbox.

#### Key engineering achievements

| Focus | Highlights |
|-------|------------|
| **Modular stack** | `simulate_solow()` (~200 LOC) computes Δk, TFP, factor returns, logs, and auxiliary flows period‑by‑period, then feeds tidy results to the UI. |
| **Dynamic experiments** | Reusable helpers build four DT tables with add/delete buttons, Excel upload, and reactive storage—analysts can batch‑load hundreds of parameter overrides without touching code. |
| **Endogenous shock layer** | A second helper lets users overwrite core state variables (A, L, k, K, Y, Δk) for one‑off regime‑switch scenarios. |
| **Data integration** | Reads multi‑sheet World Bank workbooks, filters any country‑year window, converts the average savings rate into a slider, and re‑simulates instantly. |

#### Visual analytics & UX

* Ten high‑resolution ggplot dashboards—capital (K), output (Y), efficiency units (k), Δk/k, MPL, MPK, and log‑scales.  
* Visibility toggles add counterfactual, 2nd‑, 3rd‑, and 4th‑scenario lines without clutter.  
* One‑click downloads: ZIP of all PNGs and CSV of results.  
* Custom **bslib** theme, responsive widths, and intelligent point‑thinning keep plots crisp for horizons up to 150 periods.

---

#### Economic rigor

* Implements the Solow steady‑state \(k^\*\) with R&D spill‑ins \((z\ell)\) and iterates growth with full accumulation dynamics.  
* Calculates MPL and MPK from the Cobb‑Douglas form, plus logs and percent changes—demonstrating clear command of calculus‑driven macro metrics.

---

#### Software craftsmanship

* Version‑tagged comments (`v2.3`, `v4.1`, etc.) track evolution.  
* Defensive input validation, informative modals, and namespaced modules prevent UI clashes.  
* Codebase is deployment‑ready for **shinyapps.io** or **RStudio Connect**.

#### Technologies showcased

| Domain | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| **Advanced R** | functional helpers, vectorized math, tidy data |
| **Shiny** | dynamic tabsets, DT tables, file I/O, downloads |
| **Data viz** | ggplot2 with consistent theming and legend control |
| **Macro growth theory** | Solow‑Romer mechanics, marginal analysis |
| **Data integration** | Excel ingestion via `rio`, reactive UI updates |

**Employer takeaway**

Eduardo translates complex growth theory into an elegant, data‑driven web tool—showcasing deep economics knowledge, production‑level R/Shiny skills, and clean software design.
