## Introduction



### Objective

In today's global economy, analyzing time series data is essential for predicting trends, understanding seasonality, and identifying unexpected shocks. The objective of this analysis is to explore China's export commodities over time, using time series analysis techniques to gain insights that can aid in strategic planning and effective decision-making.

### Why Time Series Analysis?

Time series analysis involves collecting and interpreting data recorded over time. By examining China's export data from early 1990 to the present, we can observe trends, seasonality, and irregular movements that are crucial for understanding the dynamics of international trade.

## Time Series Decomposition

### Understanding Decomposition

Time series decomposition breaks down data into three components: trend, seasonality, and irregularities. This helps us understand underlying patterns and make better forecasts.

### Why Use a Multiplicative Decomposition?

The upward trend in China's export data suggests that fluctuations in seasonality and irregularities increase in magnitude as exports grow. That's why we use a multiplicative classical decomposition model, where the data is broken down into:

1.  **Trend Component:** Captures the long-term growth pattern. Here, we observe steady growth in exports.

2.  **Seasonal Component:** Identifies repeating patterns within a year. Exports peak in December (possibly driven by holiday demand, especially in the US) and dip to their lowest in February (likely due to the Chinese New Year and post-holiday slowdowns).

3.  **Random Component:** Captures what's left after accounting for the trend and seasonal components. It represents what the model cannot explain. These unexpected changes often correlate with macroeconomic events like the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, but not all irregular variations can be directly linked to specific events.

### Multiplicative Classical Decomposition Model

```{r}
#| fig-cap: "Fig 2 - Classical Multiplicative Decomposition of China's Exports"
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
#| warning: false

china_decompose_mult <- cexports_ts |>
  model(feasts::classical_decomposition(exports_commodities, type = "mult"))  |>
  components()

decompose_plot <- autoplot(china_decompose_mult) +
  ggtitle("Fig 2 - Classical Multiplicative Decomposition of China's Exports") +
  labs(subtitle = "Export commodities = trend (billions) * seasonal * random")

decompose_plot

# Save the plot as a PNG file
#ggsave("fig2_mult_decomposition.png", plot = decompose_plot, width = 12, height = 6, dpi = 300)

```

## Seasonal Component

```{r}
#| fig-cap: "Fig 3 - China's Exports Commodities Seasonal Component"
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
#| warning: false

plot_decomp_seasonal <- ggplot(china_decompose_mult %>% filter(index >= yearmonth('2019 Dec') & index <= yearmonth('2021 Jan')), aes(x = index, y = seasonal)) +
  geom_line(group = 1, color = "blue") +
  geom_point(color = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Fig 3 - China: Exports Commodities Seasonal Component",
       x = "Month",
       y = "Seasonal") +
  scale_x_yearmonth(
    labels = scales::label_date("%b"),  
    breaks = "1 months"                    
  )  + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

plot_decomp_seasonal


# Save the plot as a PNG file
#ggsave("fig3_seasonal_component.png", plot = plot_decomp_seasonal, width = 12, height = 6, dpi = 300)

```

### Random Component and Macroeconomic Events

These unexpected changes often correlate with macroeconomic events like the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. For example, in response to a slowdown (random shock), China increased export tax rebates in March 2015 to stimulate exports, showing how responses can occur after the initial shock. This randomness highlights inherent uncertainties—macroeconomic disruptions may explain some shocks, but many remain unpredictable. Understanding the random component helps us see where patterns could align—but also where uncertainties remain.

# 
# -   Export Tax Rebate Reductions (July 2004): China reduced export tax rebates on low-value-added goods to curb excessive growth in low-end manufacturing exports.
# 
# -   Yuan Revaluation (July 2005): China moved away from the fixed peg to the USD, allowing the Yuan to appreciate gradually, which affected export prices.
# 
# -   Global Financial Crisis (September 2008): The collapse of Lehman Brothers triggered a global financial crisis, sharply reducing demand for Chinese exports.
# 
# -   Chinese Government Stimulus Package (November 2008): A \$586 billion stimulus package focused on infrastructure and domestic demand to offset declining exports due to the global crisis.
# 
# -   Export Tax Rebate Increase (June 2009): The government increased export tax rebates for various industries to support exporters during the global recession.
# 
# -   Labor Strikes and Wage Increases (May 2010): A series of labor strikes led to wage hikes in manufacturing sectors, increasing export production costs.
# 
# -   End of Export Subsidies (December 2010): China phased out some export subsidies in compliance with WTO rules, impacting export prices for certain commodities.
# 
# -   Export Tax Rebate Increases (March 2015): To counter slowing exports, China increased export tax rebates in March 2015 for textiles, machinery, and electronics to stimulate export growth.

### Why a Multiplicative Decomposition Model Fits

The multiplicative model is particularly suitable because the amplitude of seasonal changes and irregular fluctuations increases along with the trend. In China's export data, as exports grow, the seasonal variations and irregularities also become more pronounced. A multiplicative model accounts for this proportionality, making it appropriate for capturing the dynamics of the data.

### Why an Additive Decomposition Model Would Not Work

An additive model assumes that the size of seasonal and irregular variations remains constant regardless of the trend. However, the data shows that fluctuations grow as the trend grows. Therefore, an additive model would fail to accurately represent the increasing variability linked to higher export levels.

### Additive Classical Decomposition Model Plot

autoplot(china_decompose_add) +
  ggtitle("Fig 5 - Classical Additive Decomposition of China's Exports")

```

## Key Takeaways

-   **Seasonal Patterns:** Understanding these can help companies optimize their supply chains, especially during high-demand months.

-   **Economic Resilience:** The trend shows that China’s export sector has consistently been increasing over time.

-   **Strategic Planning:** By anticipating seasonal lows (like in February) and leveraging peaks (in December), businesses can better align their operations with demand cycles.

## Recommendations

Given the observed seasonality, trend, and irregular components of China's export data, it is important to prepare for upcoming political events that could potentially lead to a temporary fall in exports. However, based on historical patterns, China has demonstrated resilience and the ability to recover fairly quickly from these disruptions. Therefore, we recommend the following actionable items:

-   **Diversify Supply Chains:** Identify and establish relationships with alternative suppliers and markets to reduce dependence on China during potential disruptions.

-   **Increase Inventory Buffer:** Build up inventory reserves during periods of high export activity to prepare for potential downturns caused by political events.

-   **Monitor Key Indicators:** Closely monitor geopolitical developments and economic indicators to respond proactively to any signals of impending disruptions.

-   **Establish Contingency Plans:** Develop and maintain contingency plans to address short-term declines in supply, including logistical adjustments and finding new suppliers.

-   **Communicate with Partners:** Maintain open communication with Chinese suppliers and partners for early warnings of potential issues.

-   **Leverage Seasonal Patterns:** Use the identified seasonal peaks to strategically schedule production and export needs, ensuring that reserves are built up during times of predictable high export activity.

## Conclusion

The decomposition of China’s export data reveals a strong upward trend, along with predictable seasonal fluctuations and irregular disruptions. While upcoming political events may lead to short-term declines, historical data shows that these are typically followed by rapid recovery. By understanding these trends, seasonality, and random components, businesses can better prepare for potential disruptions without significant long-term impacts.

The key insight is that while risks are present, proactive preparation can mitigate their effects. By leveraging strategic planning, maintaining communication, and building contingency buffers, companies can continue to operate smoothly and minimize disruptions. This approach ensures resilience in the face of political uncertainties, relying on the observed adaptability of China’s export capabilities.
